/* 
What is this referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game.
	* the "this" is referring to your object, aka Thorin. The "commands" you are giving him are actually functions, and the this. 
	format is used to call functions on certain objects.
What does the () do in JavaScript?
	* the "()" is where you place your arguments for whatever function you are calling.
What is the point of the semicolons?
	* the semicolons, is used to seperate statements either on the same line but can be optional if seperated by a line break.

 
 
 
// Reflection:

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
	* I thought code combat was straight forward so I didn't really have a strategy besides follow the guidelines. Only problems
	I faced were mildly related to the interphase of code combat, or else I was fine.
What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
	* No questions while coding.
What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
	* None
Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
	* Going through the motions of js syntax was helpful as a refresher
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
	* I am confident with each of the learning competencies to the fullest extent.
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
	* N/A
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	* I felt I just wanted to get through it. This should be reserved for someone who has never dealt with any programming before
	because it's just a long excercise in syntax essentially. I understand why this would benefit someone who is new to programming 
	immensly, but for me that was not the case. I can appreciate the excercise for what it is.
