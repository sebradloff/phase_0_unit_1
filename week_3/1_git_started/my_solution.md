## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
* The add command brings the current files to Git's attention, ready for their commit.

#### branch
* The branch command allows you to build a new branch away from the master branch, in which you cna make your on changes. This is helpful for when you are working with multiple people, because you can edit your own section without messing up everyone elses code and vice versa.

#### checkout
* Allows you to navigate to and "look" at other repositories. This can be other branches of the current repository or a completely different repo.

#### clone
* Clone allows to make a copy of the repository into a new directory.

#### commit
* This is essentially a save function. You are saving a current version of your project and generally include a message of what you changed.

#### fetch
* Fetch allows you to grab from a single repository or multiple. This allows you to download objects and references.

#### log
* Shows your commit log for a repository. You would use this to figure where you implemented  a certain change to utilize version control.

#### merge
* This allows you to merge multiple repository changes. Helpful when you have multiple people working on a project and you want all changes reflected in one document.

#### pull
* It takes current changes from a remote repository and incorporates them into your current local repository. Useful to remain up to date on the project.

#### push
* Used to "push" your commits to GitHub from Git.

#### reset
* This resets your current HEAD to a previous state. This allows you to go back to previous working states and is the whole point of version control.

#### rm
* Removes whatever file you want from your tree.

#### status
* Shows the current working tree. This lets you also know where you are currently editing/working from on the tree.


## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
	* git push -u <name> <branch name>
- Fetch changes
	* git fetch
- Commit locally
	* git commit -m "Message here"

## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
2. Solution
3. Cause (explain the error)

## Release 6: Reflection

* 1) The main issue I faced was using the command line, where to initialize the git repository for and how to push it. None of this was truly explained and it honestly should be. Blind faith would be great to at least begin to comprehend what the hell is going on. Reading through the majority of the material is dense and not really actionable for me as a beginner using git. 
* 2) Read above
* 3) Still having trouble using the command line but am going to keep working with it to see how it all works.
* 4) I learned how to use git and push to github from the command line.
* 5) Not completely comfortable with those changes yet, but I will be soon.
* 6) I enjoyed reading about git and github, going through the interactive tutorials was nice.
* 7) Nothing was necessarily tedious, just wish there was a little more hand holding for the portion of where to init the git and how to push specifically.
