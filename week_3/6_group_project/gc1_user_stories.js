// My role in the group is: Person 1

// Here is my part of the challenge:

I want to be able to do the following things with a group of numbers, even or odd number of numbers. 
	1) I want to be able to sum all the numbers in a group.
	2) I want to be able to calculate the mean of a group of numbers.
	3) I want to be able to calculate the median of a group of numbers.

You should come up with a way to test each of these abilities, making sure they work.
