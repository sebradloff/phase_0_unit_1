My name is Sebastian, currently living in Chicago. I'm linking to my GitHub as repo as assignment 9 says. I'm excited to look at y'alls work and leave comments.

Happy Weekend,
Sebastian

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
