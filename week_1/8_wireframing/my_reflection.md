* 1) I learned that it's beautifully simplistic and a relatively long process to achieve the results. I like the design and user experience to a certain extent. Wireframing the sites was fun, because it really showed me how intuitive the use of the sites were to users. They are purposefully catching the user's eye with simple choices which fascinate me.

* 2) During this challenge, I tried to read as much as I could about wireframing and the design process, to truly understand how one builds a great looking website with a positive UX. I used all given resources and some googling to learn more.
* 3) I didn't really have any trouble with the assignment, I just kind of understood the concepts and went forward.
* 4) I learned about wireframing and how important it is to website design. It's something I never really thought of before, and it gives me a better appreciation for well designed sites.
* 5) I feel incredibly confident.
* 6) I enjoyed actually wireframing the sites by hand. That was fun to reverse engineer the process.
* 7) A lot of repitiveness in the reading, but it was necessary to drive home certain points.
