* 1) I don't even know where to start on what sort of questions I asked myself during this challenge. I saw this as an opportunity to fully explore CSS and HTML. The first question I had, was where the hell do padding, borders, and margins fit in the .HTML file. Turns out they don't, all located in CSS, and that is a serious typo that drove me up a wall for the better part of a half hour.
* 2) Still having trouble with psuedo-classes, but I'll try to use them more often to grasp a better understanding. I really hate padding and borders. I had real issues with padding the top of text elements. I set it to 0 in multiple different ways, and there is still a ton of space above the text. I still need to figure out what is happening.
* 3) I learned a lot through the process. The class and id marking is incredibly helpful, but there has to be a better way to mark certain sections of html as the same class.
* 4) I feel incredibly confident that I have a good foundation in CSS and HTML.
* 5) I enjoyed putting together my own content and seeing the draft table I created, remain in a fixed position. It just felt official.
* 6) I found the padding section annoying, as previously mentioned, or else I was pretty much ok. I need to figure out a better way to position elements on the page, but I would say I did a pretty good job.
