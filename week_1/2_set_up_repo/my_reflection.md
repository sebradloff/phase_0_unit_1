## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* 1) Creating a repository on GitHub is simple. Fill out the owner and repository name sections. Check the "public" box if you would like anyone to view your repository. By checking the initialize this repository with README box, you are cloning the repository to your own computer. Simply click create repository and you're ready to go.
* 2) Open source in a sense, mean free to see the source code to a project. This means I can see the "guts" of a project instead of just its output. There are several different liscencing schemes which prevent the sale of open source code, or different terms of use.
* 3) I think Open Source is a great thing to a certain extent. It's great because everyone can see, admire, and learn from your work. It makes me nervous, because I think the system can be abused, with people exploiting open source projects, which were meant to be free to the public, and then monetizing the project. I hope I am wrong, but I could easily see that becoming a problem in the future. I would say it feels less like a Utopia, but more like one of the greatest libraries ever built.
* 4) Each type of liscence have their own "advantages" or "disadvantages" depending on how you feel about open source projects and monetization. I think the MIT liscencing is pretty clever for the most part. It stipulates, if you use the code from a project with that liscencing, you can monetize/use the code however you wish, but you have to include the liscence in your own code. This essentially means you have to open source you own project and allow other people to make money off of it.
* 5) No true "aha" moments or problems. Just found the plethora of liscencing agreements to be very interesting. I struggled to understand some of the liscencing technicalities, but I re-read them once I had a better sense of the material, and it made sense.
* 6) Unfortunately, no.
