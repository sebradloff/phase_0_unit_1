Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

* I truly enjoyed the process. I used my knowledge from previous css and html page creations to form this one. The content isn't something that truly interested me, but it was a great excercise in getting me to think about website front end design. I found it (still do) the process of writing an HTML page with CSS elements. I get it, that the CSS template is helpful when creating multiple HTML pages that you want formated the same way, saving you time. However, why don't you just copy and paste the relevant HTML coding along with the CSS features embedded for your new HTML page? I feel that with more practice I'll come to understand more and more about HTML and CSS.
