## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1) I had trouble understanding what to do for each section. There is so much material thrown at you, that sometimes it's difficult to know which is the correct way to install GitHub or Git, along with the proper setup. I learned that there are many ways to install Git and GitHub, but there has to be a better way to teach this stuff. Just a very simple guide that screams, "hey, over here! Read this thing first, because it tells you how to set it up and the basics of Git and Github. If you want to learn more, here are other links." Just my two cents.
2) I understand Git and GitHub as both being very similar tools, with the simple changes on the audience. The audience for Git is just you on your computer. You are creating multiple versions of your file, so you can test certain portions of code and decide to scrap any branch you don't like and choose the best one. This makes sure you don't ruin any part of your project by accidentally deleting a piece which later became important. Now GitHub, essentially allows you to do the same thing, except with people on the internet. You can now share your file with multiple people who are creating their own versions and integrating their code with your code. Eventually, you can merge their code into your project if it does what you feel is correct.
3) Version control is exactly what it sounds like. You are creating multiple versions of your file, as you go along to create your project. This allows you to step back at any point in time and work from a previously deleted segment of the file. GitHub, helps with that, by hosting your file on the internet and allows multiple people to create their own version of a base file, and contribute to that file. The orginial file is never overwritten and you can eventually merge the branches into one file.
4) It makes total sense to use version control. I've done it so many times with other files, where I deleted a section which I thought was unnecessary at the time, later proving to be important. Instead of rewriting the entire section, I can easily go back to a previous version, and copy and paste that code into my new version.
5) Why use Git and GitHub, makes sense. How to use GitHub to contribute to projects, does not yet make sense.
