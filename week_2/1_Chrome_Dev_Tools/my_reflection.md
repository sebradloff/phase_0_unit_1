# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
	* The DOM is a programming interface that connects the HTML with your programming lanugage of your webpage, so you can change the style, layout, etc. It's actually super awesome, because it allows you to call certain elements from your HTML page to incorporate into the programming language. For example, you can call all odd numbered paragraphs to print in blue, rather than having to slap the id or class tag on manually. The skillcrush article should definitely be the first article listed. I had a headache trying to read the other one first, simply because it was loaded with too many new terms at once. I can't really think of anything bad about it.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
	*There is no javascript on my github site compared to my wordpress site. The code is wayyy easier to follow on the github site since the page is incredibly simple. My github site is significantly more optmized than my wordpress site.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
	* I found the Chrome Web Tools to be fun for the most part. Had a difficult time with getting the select hover tool to work properly. I still don't fully understand how to work it. There has to be a better way to teach that. I changed it for one individual element and all of a sudden it's applied to the whole list. Unbelievable! I clearly need to play around with it some more to grasp a better understanding.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	*The challenge was relatively straight forward. No true aha moments, more "holy crap that's really coo/a good idea" moments. I appreciate the simplicity in the Dev Tools layout.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I feel confident that I have mastered the learning competencies for this section. Hardest part, as I said earlier, was definetly the hover portion. I also struggled with editing the correct section of CSS for the proper element, but with some trial and error I eventually figured it out. Overall, I enjoyed learning about Dev Tools and plan on using them in the future.
