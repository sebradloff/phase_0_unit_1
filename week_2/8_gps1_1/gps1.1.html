        <h2>Driver</h2>
        <p>The Driver is the one typing all the code. He or she is in the "present", "the now", and soley
            focused on creating the code for this particular task which the Navigator has assigned.

        <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
        
        <p>A programming technique where two programmers write code collaboratively, one as the driver and one as the navigator. Using this technique 
        reduces the amount of error in software, as it allows one person to write the code while the other can look for mistakes. Two sets of eyes are
        always better than one!
        </p>

        <h2>Why Pair-Programming is Important to DBC?</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Helps You Remember</li>
            <p>There are many little things that you have a hard time rembembering when you are first learning a new skill. 
            Working with someone who is also learning a new skill allows you to fill them in when they forget details and them to fill you in.
            It makes the process much more efficient!
            </p>
            <li>Helps You Learn</li>
            <p>When you're explaining concepts, you are reinforcing your knowlege and thereby helping you learn the material. You also will
            quickly see what you know and what you don't know. If you can't reasonably explain your ideas to a partner
            you probably don't know the material as well as you thought.
            </p>
            <li>Learning From Your Friends</li>
            <p>When learning from your friends, you will also become closer friends with them outside of the work enviornmnet. 
            Bonding over a common experience (or struggle) lets you become more comfortable with them.
            </p>
            
        </ul>

    <div id="col-md-2b">
        <h2>Navigator</h2>
        <p>The Navigator is responsible for both directing the Driver and keeping the "big picture" in mind. 
            The Navigator keeps the Driver on track and guides them through the project until completion. They are
            more focused on where you are "going."
