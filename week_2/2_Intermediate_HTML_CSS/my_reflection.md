# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
	* I think web standards are a great idea because it allows everyone to read each other's code without getting too lost. Also, it provides great uniformity, if people adhere to those standards, for writing scripts to pull specific data from websites.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	* The standard structure is relatively intuitive to me. The semantic and explicit declarations are great. "<section>" is reserved for a set of html elements that you are grouping together. I.E. if you were wrting a page about american sports which are football, basketball, and baseball, you could place a section tag around each of the different sports with their content. The "<article>" tag is more of a self contained piece of content that flows together. Let's say for the baseball section, you have the rules, popular players, and the history of the game. You would place the article tag around each one of those elements in your post, organzing it under the sub-header of baseball. 
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
	* I love these new elements, because I don't have to spend the time tagging them through ID or Class.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
	* The reset.css is necessary to enhance cross browser compatability. The presentation defaults across different browsers are different (shocker!). Therefore, it's a good idea to have reset.css in your css file.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
	* Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE (I know), and Opera. I never really noticed any differences, because about 3-4 years ago, I began using Chrome instead of anything else. I don't necessarily think that it's good or bad that they display websites differently, I'm sure the browsers were all just made for dfferent purposes. That being said, anything other than Chrome is simply wrong!
