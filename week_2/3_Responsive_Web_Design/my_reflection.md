# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
	* Responsive web design is the designing of websites for multiple devices with differing resolutions. I like it a lot and think it's a great practice. Writing CSS in percentages allows for maintainable code when adding multiple resolutions. In the end, the user will be thankful for the different layout depending on the device which they are using to access your site.
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
	* Smartphones and Tablets have changed our consumption habits of the internet. Creating a mobile website, used to be a thing only larger corporations did. Now, everybody needs a mobile, tablet, and regular desktop site. I think Google Glass and Occulus Rift, will only continue the trend of creating websites to suit differing resolutions.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
	* People who are visually impaired can't fully utilize the web. There are screen readers, which read exactly what's on the screen to them, however, it's incredibly annoying and takes forever to simply browse. The better option are the newer braille keyboards, allowing them to read the web similar to a physical newspaper. I don't think development on the web should be specifically aimed at the visually impaired, however, if you're a good web designer, your images and visuals should be labeled properly, thereby allowing anyone to know what they're "viewing", independent of impairment.
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
	* Using em, percentages, and jqueries seem to be invaluable for creating a maintainable website. Nothing truly seems stupid, but I accept that I do not know everything about web design to comment on what is stupid.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
