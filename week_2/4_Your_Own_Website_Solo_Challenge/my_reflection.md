# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://sradloff23.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?
	* I learned going in with a plan is a good idea, but that it can be okay to deviate from that plan and experiment. I felt I was experimenting and tinkering with my design until I got it just right. I learned a lot more about how CSS and HTML interact, and also gained an appreciation for well designed websites. 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	* I liked the process to a certain extent. It was fun to work on my own site, but it didn't really feel like my own site until I decided to include information about me. After that, I felt I had more freedom to create my page as a reflection of who I am, rather than just a school assignment. That made it fun. Experimenting from there was great.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
	* Going in with a plan worked to a certain degree. The basic layout was great and I stuck to it. The details came with experimentation and actually realizing what I wanted on my page.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
	* I'll probably experiment with a pure music section or sports section, dedicated to my thoughts on those subjects.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
	* It was a lot of fun applying what I learned and combining research from the web. I find I am very much a copy paste programmer who keeps chaging the code to see what it does. That helps me understand the process and craft my own code to do what I want it to do.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	* Duke posted an excellent resource in the Google+ group: http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/
	It's on CSS positioning and I think it should become mandatory reading
