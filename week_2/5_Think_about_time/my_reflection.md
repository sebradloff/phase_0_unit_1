# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
	* Currently, not having a fixed schedule of when I will be working on challenges.
* How will you combat that? 
	* I plan on creating a set schedule that I stick to for phase 0.
* What techniques will you try?
	* I'll try figuring out what my best state is for to be in the "flow" I always believed the morning to be the best time for me to get work done, therefore, I'll start waking up earlier to see if that helps. 
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
	* Wake up earlier every morning. Have a set goal of challenges to finish each day. Preview the content the day before so I can prioritize my time.
