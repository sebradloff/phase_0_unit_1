# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
	* Currently, not having a fixed schedule of when I will be working on challenges.
* How will you combat that? 
	* I plan on creating a set schedule that I stick to for phase 0.
* What techniques will you try?
	* I'll try figuring out what my best state of "flow". I always believed the morning to be the best time for me to get work done, therefore, I'll start waking up earlier to see if that helps. 
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
	* Wakeup 6:00 am
	* Working on the daily challenges from 6 - 10 am
	* Making sure I have my work split evenly over the first 3-4 days of the week, giving me a 3 day buffer in case there is a difficult project.
	* Kick ass
